Installation
============

Zlm is only available for windows for now. However, if you are a more advance user you can build it from
source, see how on the project `github
<https://github.com/JonasOuellet/zLayerManager>`_. 


Download
--------

You can download the latest version `here
<https://www37.zippyshare.com/d/jEVxvUFP/50254/ZLayerManager.zip>`_.


Install
-------

Once the `ZLayerManager.zip` is downloaded:

1. Navigate to your Zbrush plugin folder (it should be something like *C:\\Program Files\\Pixologic\\ZBrush 2018\\ZStartup\\ZPlugs64*).

2. **If you have already installed a version of ZLayerManager before**, make sure to follow these steps, otherwise you can go 
to step 3.

    #. Close Zbrush
    #. Search of these files and delete them

        * ZlmData
        * zLayerManager.txt
        * zLayerManager.zsc

3. Extract the content of `ZLayerManager.zip` in the current `ZPlugs64` folder. (You should now see a new file `zLayerManager.txt` and a new folder `ZlmData`).
4. Open Zbrush
5. Open the `Zscript` palette and click on `Load`
6. Browse to the previously extracted `zLayerManager.txt` file.
7. You should now see the `zLayerManager` menu at the bottom of the `Zplugin` palette.
8. ZLayerManager is now ready to use !

Click on `open` to open the standalone UI. *Note: You must have a subtool selected to open the UI*
