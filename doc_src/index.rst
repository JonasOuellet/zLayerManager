ZLayerManager
=============

ZLayerManager *(Zlm)* is a ZBrush tool to aid users work with multiple layers in a scene. Zlm is a standalone interface 
that keep track of layer state and make basic layer operation easier (activate, merge, duplicate, rename etc).  It can also serve
as a bridge with other application.

ZLayerManager can be used for facial blendshape sculpting with over 100 layers or for a simple scene sculpt with a dozen of layers.

This is an open source project and all the code is available on `github
<https://github.com/JonasOuellet/zLayerManager>`_.  

Although, the tool is free of use, your support is welcome.  Support me by doing a `donation
<#donation>`_.
