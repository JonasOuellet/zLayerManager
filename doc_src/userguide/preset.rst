Preset
======

Preset can be used if you want to activate multiple layers at the same time and set a specific layer to record.

It can be useful when you are sculpting facial blenshape and you have additive blenshape where as a layer need other layer
activated deform correctly.

There are two type of layer preset:

* **Read-only**: Located in *ZlmData\\presets* under the Zbrush startup plug folder, this type of preset can't be edited by the user.  This is probably where you want to put a preset file that you want to share with other users.

* **Editable**: Located in *C:\\Users\\{username}\\zLayerManager\\presets*.  This is the default preset type and this is where the preset file will be saved when you create a new preset.

In the first row, there is a drop down list that show all the available preset file, a **+** button to create and a **-** to remove a
preset file.

In second row:

* List of available presets
* **Save button:** this will override the current preset with the actual layer configuration (it will remember which layer is activated and recoding so you can apply this preset later).
* **Add button:** this will create a new preset with the actual layer configuration.
* **Remove button:** this will remove the current preset.

Lastly, there is the most important of all the **activate** button to activate the current preset.
