Export
======

This is used to export layer from Zbrush.

If an **External Application** is set up and **Send to app** is checked, exported layer(s) will be automatically imported
in your 3D software.

You don't need to have an **External Application** set up to use export functions.  If you don't
have one set up and/or you don't have **Send to app** checked, it will only export to the specified **File folder**.


**All:** Export all layers.

**Selected:** Export selected layer(s).

**Active:** Export active layer(s).

**Record:** Export layer that is currently recording.

**Base Mesh:** Export base subtool (with no layer active).

**Subdivision:** Export *mesh* with the specified subdivision level. By default, the subdivision is 1. **Warning:** using
a too high subdivision level might extremely slow the process.
